## daily-selfie
This is my implementation of the project for the Coursera Programming Mobile Applications for Android course (part 2).
There are four main features:
* A camera button on the right side of the appbar that creates an intent to the Android camera app to take a picture
* The application shows a list of files that have been saved and persists across launches
* Pressing a tile with an image brings up a full screen view
* There is an alarm set to create a notification to remind the user to take their picture (for demonstration, 2 minutes)

Please see https://youtu.be/QVnCa1h0RVk for a screencast of the app running on the Android emulator (Galaxy Nexus API 18).

Todo list:
- [ ] Add a button on the actionbar to turn the alarm on or off
- [ ] Add a button to each listview item to delete that particular photo
- [ ] Add a button on the actionbar to delete all photos
- [ ] Filter the external public directory in order to display only photos from this app
